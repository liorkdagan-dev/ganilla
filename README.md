# GANILLA
GANILLA is a type of GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) that solves the image-to-image translation problem, in the domain of children’s book illustrations. In practice, when you provide a photograph to a trained GANILLA model, it will output an illustration of the input image, based on the style of a specific illustrator.
